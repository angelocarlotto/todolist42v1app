# üö® Railway Environment Variable Fix

## Problem Found

The production bundle contains the fallback URL `http://10.0.0.71:5175` instead of the Railway backend URL.

**Root Cause:** `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is NOT set in Railway.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Add Environment Variable

### Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard

1. Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your **frontend project** (the React client)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable

1. Click on **"Variables"** tab
2. Click **"New Variable"**
3. Add:
   ```
   Name:  REACT_APP_API_URL
   Value: https://todolist42v1app-api.up.railway.app
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Use YOUR actual backend URL (without trailing slash)

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding the variable, Railway will automatically redeploy your frontend.

**OR** manually trigger a redeploy:
1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click **"Deploy"** on the latest deployment
3. Select **"Redeploy"**

## üîç Verification

After redeployment, verify the fix:

### Check 1: Environment Variable in Railway

In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab, you should see:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://todolist42v1app-api.up.railway.app
```

### Check 2: Build Logs

In Railway deployment logs, look for:
```
Creating an optimized production build...
```

The build should use the environment variable.

### Check 3: Test the Bundle (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Fetch the production bundle and check contents
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://todolist42v1app-production-0c85.up.railway.app/" -UseBasicParsing
$scriptUrl = [regex]::Match($response.Content, 'src="(/static/js/main\.[^"]+\.js)"').Groups[1].Value
$bundleUrl = "https://todolist42v1app-production-0c85.up.railway.app" + $scriptUrl
$bundle = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $bundleUrl -UseBasicParsing).Content

# Check what URL is in the bundle
if ($bundle -match 'todolist42v1app-production\.up\.railway\.app') {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ SUCCESS: Railway URL found in bundle!" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå FAILED: Railway URL NOT in bundle" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

### Check 4: Test the Application

1. Visit: https://todolist42v1app-client.up.railway.app/
2. Open Browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab
3. Try to login or register
4. Check the API calls - they should go to:
   ```
   https://todolist42v1app-api.up.railway.app/api/auth/login
   ```
   NOT to `http://10.0.0.71:5175`

## üìù Important Notes

### For Create React App (react-scripts):

1. ‚úÖ Environment variables MUST start with `REACT_APP_`
2. ‚úÖ They are replaced at BUILD TIME, not runtime
3. ‚úÖ Must be set in Railway BEFORE the build runs
4. ‚úÖ Requires redeploy to take effect (automatic after adding variable)

### Common Mistakes:

‚ùå **Setting variable AFTER build:** Won't work, needs redeploy
‚ùå **Wrong variable name:** Must be exactly `REACT_APP_API_URL`
‚ùå **Setting in backend project:** Must be set in FRONTEND project
‚ùå **Trailing slash:** Should NOT have trailing slash

---

## üéØ Expected Result

After fixing:

### Before (Current - WRONG):
```javascript
// In production bundle:
const API_BASE_URL = "http://10.0.0.71:5175";
```

### After (Expected - CORRECT):
```javascript
// In production bundle:
const API_BASE_URL = "https://todolist42v1app-api.up.railway.app";
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Variable added but still not working

**Solution:** Make sure you're adding to the FRONTEND project, not backend
- Frontend URL: `https://todolist42v1app-client.up.railway.app`
- Backend URL: `https://todolist42v1app-api.up.railway.app`

### Issue: Build still using fallback

**Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Variable name is exactly `REACT_APP_API_URL` (case-sensitive)
2. ‚úÖ Value has no trailing slash
3. ‚úÖ Value uses `https://` not `http://`
4. ‚úÖ Redeploy was triggered after adding variable
5. ‚úÖ Build logs show successful completion

### Issue: Can't find Variables tab

Railway UI changes sometimes:
- Look for **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Environment Variables"**
- Or **"Variables"** in left sidebar
- Or click on the service ‚Üí **"Variables"** tab

## ‚úÖ Quick Command to Verify After Fix

```powershell
# Run this after Railway redeploys
Write-Host "Checking if environment variable was replaced..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://todolist42v1app-client.up.railway.app/" -UseBasicParsing
$scriptUrl = [regex]::Match($response.Content, 'src="(/static/js/main\.[^"]+\.js)"').Groups[1].Value
$bundle = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://todolist42v1app-client.up.railway.app$scriptUrl" -UseBasicParsing).Content
if ($bundle -match "todolist42v1app-api\.up\.railway\.app") {
    Write-Host "‚úÖ FIXED!" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Still broken - check Railway variables" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select frontend project
3. Add `REACT_APP_API_URL` variable
4. Wait for automatic redeploy
5. Test the application

üéâ After this fix, your application will correctly connect to the backend API!
