# Docker Compose Environment Variables
# These are used during docker compose build

# React App API URL (BUILD TIME - baked into bundle)
# For local development with Docker Compose:
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://todolist42v1app-api.up.railway.app

# For production Railway deployment, change to:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://todolist42v1app-api.up.railway.app

# Note: This variable is used at BUILD TIME by Create React App
# It gets hardcoded into the JavaScript bundle during npm run build
